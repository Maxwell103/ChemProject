# ChemicalCharts Project

Welcome to the ChemicalCharts project repository! This project is a collection of data analysis and chart generation scripts related to chemical data. 

Read the project document to get an understanding.

There are multiple data augmentation files since there was a lot of trial and error to achieve the results needed in the output diagram.

The data generator generates the augmented data in a file, that can be used for training in the neural network models.


## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several key directories:

- OriginalCharts: Contains the original charts created during the initial stages of the project.
- ProcessedCharts: Includes charts that have undergone processing and refinement for better clarity and presentation.
- plots: Stores various plots and visualizations generated throughout the project.
- hed-edge-detector-master: A submodule or external tool related to edge detection, possibly used in the project.
- Data Generator.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file for generating synthetic data.
- attempt2.ipynb, data aug 2.ipynb, data aug 3.ipynb, data aug 4.ipynb, data augmentation.ipynb: Notebooks showcasing different attempts and techniques for data augmentation.
- debug_seed_points.png: Debugging image file, providing insights into seed points.
- deploy.prototxt: Deployment configuration file, potentially related to a machine learning model.
- environment.yml: YAML file specifying the project's environment, useful for replication.
- modeling.html, modeling.ipynb: HTML and Jupyter Notebook files focusing on modeling aspects.
- output_ternary_plot_colored.png: Output image of a ternary plot with colored data points.
